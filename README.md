The solutions for Codingbat excercises

I made all of the available coding practice at http://codingbat.com/java, and uplaoded it.

The execises are organized in different files, as topics as you can find on the website.

Commenting on the descriptions of tasks can be found directly before the solutions.

Feel free to comment.
